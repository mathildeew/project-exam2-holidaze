# Project Exam 2 - Holidaze

The final exam project at Noroff. The project is an extensive application that showcase all skills gained throughout the last two years. Holidaze is an accommodation booking site that provides the customer-facing side where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

  ## Design and identity
![holidaze-styleguide](https://github.com/mathildeew/project-exam2-holidaze/assets/94295012/4c1fb655-6600-4812-8d67-f0fc7ed1545e)

With no specifications to the design and user stories, it was obvious to me that the overall feeling of the design should be associated with a sunset - which many sees as an ultimate traveling experience. This is reflected both in the logo as well as the color palette.

I kept the layout design quite minimal as I wanted the content to be the main focus. There is a big difference between the prototype and the final product, I had to make several adjustments to design while I built the application to tighten the concept and make things work.
